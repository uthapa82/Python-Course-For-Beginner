# 1. Take a list as a user input, first and last number, change the first and last element#
#  of the list                                                                            #
#   function name ==> swap_element(user_list, first, last)                                #

# 2. Write a function which takes two numbers and find the maximum and minimum numbers    #
#     function name ==> max_min(num1, num2)                                               #

# 3. Write a function that takes a word as input from user and prints 'the word is even'  #
#    if the word contains even number of character, else print 'the word is odd           #
#      funtion name ==>  odd_even(user_string )                                           #
#                                                                                         #

#         Maximim number is : 9                                                           #
#         Minimum number is : 6                                                           #

#         Please enter a word: Anu                                                        #
#         The word is odd (because Anu is three character 'a', 'n', 'u')                  #

    Remove below when you're done with this exercise 
    
    for exercise 1 you can take list as a input in a similar way we talked in day1 exercise 1 
    then just take first and last number from user and change the element in that postion
    like list_user[0] = what user want to change 
    
    for exercise 2 it's just a conditional if and else statement that's it 

    for exercise 3 it's similar to list_length in day1 exercise but you might need to add some
    conditionals to check odd and even  that's it 

    Good luck and PLEASE TRY TO FOLLOW THE CONVENTIONS WE DISCUSSED and no extra .py files this
    should be one file that's it
