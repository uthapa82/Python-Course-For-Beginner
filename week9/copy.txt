This is the story of how Joe Squeeb lost his job and got a better one, all because he threw a monkey wrench into the greatest scientific marvel of the twenty-first century. I know the story because I used to break news on the teletype for the B. J. News Agency.

The B. J. News Agency has no ear for euphony, however, so I had to leave them and I'm writing these memoirs while I wait for old B. J. to apologize.

The first release that touched on Joe Squeeb's case was ticked off by me on the master sender. I still got a copy, as follows:

SASSOON SEIZES SOLVER. PROFESSOR CONNOR CLAIMS IN COURT THAT CONFISCATION OF BRAIN MACHINE IS ILLEGAL.

I remember I paused a couple of minutes for dramatic effect before I sent out the rest of it:

SCIENTIFIC CIRCLES SEEK SOLACE IN SAFE SILENCE. ODDS 10 TO 1 ON SASSOON. AP.

The AP stands for me, Alfred Pennyfeather, and the B. J. News Agency always quotes odds for its customers so they'll know how to write up the stuff in their papers.

A little while after I sent out the release, old B. J. himself prodded me in the ribs. B. J. is a beetle-browed person with gruff voice and a red face which can wear a very unpleasant expression. Also he has pale blue eyes like chilled marbles.

"Pennyfeather," he says, "cut the comic headlines. Let our customers think up their own. You just give 'em the story."

"Yessir," I agree. But I don't like that crack about comic headlines.

"And get some dope on the Solver," he growls as he stamps out. "Make it brief."
